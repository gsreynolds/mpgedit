Welcome to the Mac OS X Installer for MPGEDIT. 
<p>
This
package will install the command-line mpgedit on your
system.  The installer will create a link named
/usr/bin/mpgedit pointing into the directory where you
actually installed mpgedit. Since mpgedit is a command-
line utility, you need to run this from a command shell
in a terminal window.
