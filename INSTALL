mpgedit 0.72 beta, December 2005, Adam Bernstein (http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/)
Please report success, bugs, or other issues to number6@mpgedit.org

COMPILATION
-----------
Building the software on *NIX platforms:

Linux, Solaris:
$ ./configure

Note: configure is now just a script that calls ./unix_make.sh.

Windows:
You must have Visual C++ configured for command line builds.  The
easiest way to accomplish this is run vcvars32.bat from a cmd shell.

In a directory at the same level as the mpgedit source,
download the PDCurses 2.4 package and unzip it in a directory
named 'pdcurses'.

    http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/pdc24_vc_w32.zip

You should have a directory structure something like this:

    c:\wrk\mpgedit
    c:\wrk\pdcurses

From a cmd shell, cd into wrk\mpgedit, and run win32_make.bat.

c:\mpgedit> win32_make.bat

This software release has been built and tested on Linux, Solaris and
Win32 platforms (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows 2000 have been tested). 


INSTALLATION
------------
Linux:

$ su root
$ make install

    OR

$ su root
$ ./install.sh


By default, install script copies and configures mpgedit under /usr/local
(bin, lib and man).  You are given the opportunity to change the base
install directory during the installation process.  

The Linux shared library loader (ld.so) is configured during installation.
Please remember to add the install executable directory (/usr/local/bin by
default) to your PATH environment variable.

Windows:

mpgedit uses Inno Setup (IS) to generate a Windows install package.
Currently, version 3.0.7b is being used to generate the production
install packages.  The *.iss scripts will probably work correctly
with later versions.

The xmpgedit installer resides in after a successful build:

    mpgedit\gui\Output\setup.exe


TESTING
-------
Linux:

The current regression test is "test1.sh".  You can run the regression
test by simply executing:

$ test1.pl

This test heavily exercises the editing features of mpgedit.  Each test 
performs a series of edits that results in an output file that will be
identical to the original, unedited file.  The resultant edited file is
then compared against the original source file.

The regression tests are implemented in Perl.  They will run on Windows
using Active Perl, or other Perl packages for Win32.  Active Perl 5.6.1
is currently used for mpgedit development on Windows.

Another test that can be performed using the curses mode of mpgedit
is a simplified version of the "slice and splice" test performed by
test1.pl.  Perform the following actions to execute this test:

The slice test is performed with the following actions:

  - Start mpgedit with no options
  - Press 'Enter' to close the help window
  - Enter the 'L' command, then load "test1.split"
  - Enter the 'E' command, save abandoned edits to file "test1.split2

The splice test is performed with the following actions:

  - Start mpgedit with no options
  - Press 'Enter' to close the help window
  - Enter the 'L' command, then load "test1.join"
  - Enter the 'n' command, entering the output file "test1_splice.mp3"
  - Enter the 'e' command, save abandoned edits to file "test1.join2"

Files test1.mp3 and test1_splice.mp3 should be identical.  This can be
verified by comparing these two files with diff:

  diff test1.mp3 test1_splice.mp3

Cleanup after this test with the following command:

  rm -f test1.splice.mp3 test1_*.mp3 test1_*.idx test1.split2 test1.join2

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------
Linux:
The C compiler (gcc) and make must be installed in order to build mpgedit.
These are the modules I have installed in my development system:
  egcs-1.1.2-24
  make-3.77-6

Windows:
Currently, mpgedit is built with MicroSoft Visual Studio 6.0.  Additionally
you must have your environment configured for command line builds. Running
vcvars32.bat before win32_make.bat should be sufficient to build mpgedit.
You must also have the pdcurses package installed in a directory
at a peer level with mpgedit.  You can download pdcurses from:

    http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/pdc24_vc_w32.zip

This file unzips into a directory named 'pdcurses'.  The mpgedit makefiles
expects pdcurses to be installed in a directory of this name.

Inno Setup is used by the Win32 build to generate the Windows installer.
This tool is available from:

    http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

The build of xmpgedit for Windows uses the GTK+ toolkit for Win32.
You must have installed the GTK+ development libraries for this build to
complete successfully.  GTK+ for Win32 is available from:

    http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html


UNINSTALLATION
--------------
Linux:
$ su root
$ make uninstall
