This is the README for the mpgedit SDK for Linux.  The primary purpose of
this package is to enable compilation of the python mpgedit extension
py_mpgedit, and to provide runtime support of py_mpgedit.  Developers could
use this SDK for development of MP3 editing applications in C, however this
practice is discouraged with this version.  The reason for this is the C API
present in this package is not considered public at this time.  That means
it can, and probably will, change at any time.  Any applications written
with the C API will probably break when built and run using later versions
of the mpgedit SDK.  You have been warned.

The python py_mpgedit extension is a public API and its use for development
is encouraged.  There are two sample programs provided in this release,
simple_play.py and simple_edit.py, in addition to the python extension
documentation.  See http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/sdk/py_mpgedit.htm for the
complete py_mpgedit API documentation.



INSTALLATION
------------

To install mpgedit, as root run: ./install.sh

This script will first prompt you for the install directory, /usr/local
is the default.  Press enter to install in /usr/local.  Should
/usr/local/lib not already be in your /etc/ld.so.conf file, it will be added,
and ldconfig run.

The python site-packages is determined using the version of python
visable to root at the time of install, using 'sys.prefix'.
The extension is not installed when the site-packages directory
cannot be found.

The python extension source code is installed in the 
mpgedit_sdk/py_mpgedit-__SDKMAJOR__.__SDKMINOR____SDKRELTYPE__ directory.   The following steps will build
the py_mpgedit extension:

  export MPGEDITDIR=/usr/local/mpgedit_sdk
  cd /usr/local/mpgedit_sdk/py_mpgedit-__SDKMAJOR__.__SDKMINOR____SDKRELTYPE__
  python setup.py install

Don't worry about the compiler warnings about unused variables and
labels.  These originate from the extension code generated by the 
Pyrex compiler, and do not affect the proper operation of the
extension.




UNINSTALLATION
--------------

To uninstall mpgedit, as root run: ./install.sh -u

This script will first prompt you for the uninstall directory, /usr/local
is the default.  Press enter to uninstall mpgedit from /usr/local.  The
/etc/ld.so.conf file is not updated by the uninstall script.


TESTING
-------

Run the simple_play.py application located in the examples directory.

  cd /usr/local/mpgedit_sdk/examples
  ./simple_play.py test1.mp3

The mp3 file should play.

The simple_edit.py application cuts test1.mp3 into a number of segments, 
then joins the segments into a new output file named editif_test2.mp3.  

Run the following commands to test simple_edit.py:

  cd /usr/local/mpgedit_sdk/examples
  ./simple_edit.py test1.mp3

The contents of editif_test2.mp3 are identical to test1.mp3 when this test
is successful.  The intermediate output file editif_test1.mp3 contains the
reordered edits, and was then edited to generate editif_test2.mp3.
