BACKGROUND
----------
This is the Windows installation package of xmpgedit, the graphical version
of mpgedit. This is release __XMAJOR__.__XMINOR____XRELTYPE____XCKPOINT__.  Don't let the low version number
worry you.  There has been quite a bit of development work that has resulted
in this release.  The GUI portion of this project is the newest component of
this project. However the underlying MP3 editing library is at version
__MAJOR__.__MINOR____RELTYPE__, which has been in production for over 3 years.

The major feature of this release is the graphic display of decoded mp3 volume levels,
giving the ability to select edit times from the audio levels display.
Support for Mac OS X is also a major new feature.  This product is also available
for Linux and Windows at this time.  The Windows version is known to
function on Windows 98->Windows XP.  The Linux implementation is built on
RedHat 6.2 and RedHat 7.1 systems, and should function on RedHat 6.x, 7.x
and 8.x, 9.x systems.  The RedHat 7 builds have been spot checked, and appear to
function properly on Fedora core 3 systems, and Ubuntu distributions.


INSTALLATION
------------
This package installs xmpgedit by default into this directory:

    \Program Files\mpgedit.org\xmpgedit

On Windows NT/W2K/XP, you must install xmpgedit with a user that has
system Administrator privilege.  The installer will prompt you for a
user with Administrator privilege when you attempt to install with a
user that does not.  After you enter the username and password for the
Administrator, the installation will proceed.  Otherwise, you will need
to log off the current user and log in as Administrator, then attempt the
installation again.

The PATH environment variable is updated during the install.  Before this
change is visable to cmd.exe, you must log off and log on again.
After all, this is Windows.  At least you don't have to reboot.  ;-}



UNINSTALLATION
--------------
Uninstall xmpgedit with the Windows "Add/Remove Programs" application:

    Settings->Control Panel->Add/Remove Programs.

Remove the xmpgedit 0.7beta package.



SOURCE CODE
-----------
CVS:

cvs -d \
  :pserver:anonymous@mpgedit.org:/usr/local/cvsroot login

       There is no password, just press Enter

cvs -z3 -d \
  :pserver:anonymous@mpgedit.org:/usr/local/cvsroot \
  co -r mpgedit___MAJOR__-__MINOR_____RELTYPE____CKPOINT__ mpgedit




COMPILING
---------
You must have Visual C++ configured for command line builds.  The
easiest way to accomplish this is run vcvars32.bat from a cmd shell.

Download the source:
    http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpgedit___RELEASE___src.tar.gz

Or download the source from CVS for 'latest'.

In a directory at the same level as the mpgedit source,
download the PDCurses 2.4 package and unzip it in a directory
named 'pdcurses'.

The build of xmpgedit is dependent on GTK+ 2.0 for Windows.  This
can be downloaded from:

  http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html


These packages are needed to build:
  atk-dev-1.0.3-20020821.zip
  glib-dev-2.2.1.zip
  gtk+-dev-2.2.1.zip
  libiconv-1.8-w32-1.bin.zip
  pango-dev-1.2.1.zip

The makefile for xmpgedit expects these to be installed in:

  C:\win32\tools\gtk

The makefile must be adjusted if these packages are installed elsewhere.

You should have a directory structure something like this:

    c:\wrk\mpgedit
    c:\wrk\pdcurses
    c:\win32\tools\gtk

From a cmd shell, cd into wrk\mpgedit, and run win32_make.bat.

c:\mpgedit> win32_make.bat
