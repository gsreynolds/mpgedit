Special thanks go to Jared Benedict <http://redjar.org/jared/> and Public
Radio Exchange <http://www.prx.org/> for the donation of a Macintosh
G3 B&W computer. Completion of the port to Mac OSX 10.3 was possible
using this system.

The Python mpgedit Pyrex wrapper, py_mpgedit, was written by Bryan 
Weingarten, <bryan.weingarten@mpgedit.org>.

The initial port of the command line and curses mpgedit to Mac OSX 10.1 
was done with thanks to Tony Andrea <tony.andrea@pobox.com>.

Thanks to Colin Bell <cpb@tklogic.net> for helping with freshing the Mac
OSX 10.1 port.
