.SH NAME
unscramble.pl \- Restores an mp3 file randomized by scramble.pl

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 9
unscramble.pl
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBunscramble.pl\fR is a Perl script that restores to the correct sequential
order an mp3 file that was previously randomized by scramble.pl.
\fBunscramble.pl\fR is part of the main
mpgedit regression test \fBtest1.pl\fR, or can be called as a
stand\-alone program.  

\fBunscramble.pl\fR uses as input these two files, \fBscramble.mp3\fR and
\fBscramble.out\fR, which were previously generated by \fBscramble.pl\fR.
The result of the descrambling operation is saved
in the file \fBdescramble.mp3\fR.  
The descrambled output is identical to the original \fBinputfile.mp3\fR
that was scrambled by \fBscramble.pl\fR.  

.SH BUGS
The final frame of \fBinputfile.mp3\fR always appears as the final frame
of \fBscramble.mp3\fR. The scramble start/stop times are always saved to
\fBscramble.out\fR. The loss or modification of this file makes recovery
of \fBdescramble.mp3\fR impossible.  Any ID3 tags present 
in \fBinputfile.mp3\fR are
edited away by the scramble/unscramble operation.

.SH SEE ALSO 
\fBunscramble.pl\fR(1), \fBscramble_times.pl\fR(1), 
\fBmpgedit\fR(1), \fBxmpgedit\fR(1).
